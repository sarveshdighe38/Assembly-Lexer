Install following using apt install commands
    aarch64-linux-gnu-as
    aarch64-linux-gnu-ld
    qemu-aarch64

Copy following code snippet replacing "FIRST" by your main 
subroutine name. Save it in "filename.s". Also copy your translated
code in this.

.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    mov X0, #1
    BL FIRST
    mov w8, #93 
    svc #0
    ret


Run following commands
See as and ld commands are run wihtout failures.
If there are any errors there might be issues in your translation code.

   aarch64-linux-gnu-as -mcpu=cortex-a57 filename.s -o filename.o
   aarch64-linux-gnu-ld filename.o -o filename


So we now have an executable file. We can launch it with QEMU...
   qemu-aarch64 -g 1234 ./filename

You will see that nothing happens when you enter in this command. 
It will stall. QEMU is waiting on the GNU Debugger (GDB) 
to be launched. In a second terminal (while keeping the QEMU 
terminal running), run this command...

gdb-multiarch -q --nh \
  -ex 'set architecture aarch64' \
  -ex 'file filename' \
  -ex 'target remote localhost:1234' \
  -ex 'layout split' \
  -ex 'layout regs'

  
Once, you've entered the above terminal command, you will be at 
the first instruction of the Source File
You can use basic gdb commands to navigate through execution and observe
register contents.
